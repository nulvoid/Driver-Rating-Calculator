# V2.0 - Released 2/17/24

This Python program will convert a .html file containing a table of a race season's standings into a text file with the driver's name and their calculated rating. I'm hesitant to call it a skill rating calculator, but that is how I use this program.

## Preparing a .html file

1. Navigate to the season's full point standings on Racing Reference.

2. Right click and inspect element the table containing the season's point standings.

3. Copy the HTML code for the entire table element.

4. Save the HTML code as the season's name in the Season Files folder.

## Using the program

1. When you have your .html ready, run the program.

2. Type **calc** and press enter to start the program.

3. Enter the name of the .html file you created and press enter.

4. The program will save a text file of the same name in the Ratings folder.
